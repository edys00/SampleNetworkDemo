# SampleNetworkDemo

This is a Demo App demonstrating about simple API integration using Swift 4, Auto Layout and Storyboard.
With some simple animation in the welcome screen and simple To Do List Feature added to enrich the app 
with the purpose of demonstrating some of the skills that i have as an iOS Developer.

Cheers!
